 ii.

I think the best way for storing all the information about an event would be a dictionary.
The dictionary would allow the coder to label all of the values that are listed in the dictionary.

Comparatively, a list could work if the user knew what values corresponded to what physical meaning.
Same goes for a tuple. A set wouldn't make any sense as there would be no way to know which values
correspond to which physical meaning. 



iii.

I think the best way to store many events together in a 'log' would be in a list, if you could count
on the fact that the physical events would happen chronologically, as in event 1 happened first, event
2 happened second, etc. If this were the case, then the location of the dictionary in the list could 
used as the event number identifier and each location would hold a dictionary containing all the 
pertinent information. 

If this were not the case, then I think the best container for this log would be another dictionary.
This way, regardless of the order the events are taking place, a label of the event number can be
tracked. The label of each entry in log dictionary would correspond to another dictionary containing
the information about that event. Using this system, the user/coder can call upon any event in the 
dictionary utilizing the label of that event. Since I do not know which is the case, I will use 
dictionaries in a dictionary.
